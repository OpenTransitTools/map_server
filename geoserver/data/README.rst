If you load your DB up with transit feeds (via the loader project and gtfsdb), you'll get the benefit of a geoserver
config via this project.

How to:
1. have PostGIS installed and running
1. clone the *loader* project & load your favorite transit feed into PostGIS -- https://github.com/OpenTransitTools/loader/blob/master/README.md
1. run this map_server script: bin/generate_geoserver_config
1. export GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR="$PWD/geoserver/data"
1. download and unzip standalone GeoServer -- http://geoserver.org/release/stable/
1. cd <geoserver>
1. bin/startup.sh
1. http://localhost:8080/geoserver/
1. click *Layer Preview*, and you should see various OTT transit route and stop layers
1. notes
 - this is a minimally running geoserver instance
 - map_server/geoserver/data/security/masterpw.info will be generated by GS
 - the routes & stops are (currently) everything from the installed gtfs files ... providing a 'current' materialized view is on the radar
